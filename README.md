# TICKET-RESERVATION-SYSTEM-USING-FCFS-AND-PRIORITY-SCHEDULING-
In this project we have implemented a ticket reservation system where a passenger  can book a ticket for airlines or train. We have used scheduling algorithms like First  Come First Serve (FCFS) and Priority scheduling for our implementation. The main  aim of this project is to book tickets for the passengers based on their arrival time  and age. The user can also opt the method of booking, either FCFS or priority, to  book their tickets in reservation system according to their convenience. And when  they choose the algorithm, they’ll be asked if they want to book for an airline or  train. In priority scheduling, the passenger’s age is considered as a parameter for  priority. Average waiting time and Average wait around time of passengers are  displayed after all the passenger’s booking.
